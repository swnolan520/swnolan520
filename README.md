- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @swnolan520 and I am currently a student studying finance and business analytics and information systems. I have just started learning to code with python and SQL. I'm interested on working on projects that have an application to financial market analysis or anything else that may be intersting.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I am originally from Chicago and played hockey while growing up so i am a huge fan of the Chicago Blackhawks
